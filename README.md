This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The HTML file defines the structure of the game board and includes links to the CSS file for styling and the JavaScript file for game logic. 
The CSS file contains styles for the game elements, while the JavaScript file handles the game's functionality, including player turns, win conditions, and restart functionality. 
Enjoy playing!
